## Loopback interface.
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

## When using Virtual Machines (not Physical Isolation),
## - eth0 is an internal, isolated, virtual network
## - provided and only visible inside Virtual Machines
## - solely used to communicate with the Gateway
## - it has no access to the host.
## - Thus, the following IP address can NOT cause conflicts
##   with your LAN network or router.
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
       ## Increment last octet of address
       ## on optional additional workstations.
       address 10.152.152.11
       netmask 255.255.192.0
       gateway 10.152.152.10

       ## Out commented.
       ## For what do we require the network and broadcast
       ## instances anyway?
       #network 192.168.0.0
       #broadcast 192.168.0.255

## If we had a DHCP server running on Gateway's
## network interface eth1, we could alternatively use DHCP.
## It has not been researched yet, if that were safe, or if
## DHCP has in context of anonymity linux distributions any
## odd features, such as "tell me the IP of your upstream router".
#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
