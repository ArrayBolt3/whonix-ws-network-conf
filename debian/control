 Sets up an internal network interface eth0.

 DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Workstations
 Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports anonymized system DNS
 for Workstation's traffic (also known as Transparent DNS Proxy) mainly depends
 on the Gateway's firewall.
 .
 This package is simply installing /etc/resolv.conf which points to
 10.152.152.10, where an Anon-Gateway is supposed to provide a DnsPort on port
 53. IP HARDCODED but no need to change because only description.
 .
 Currently relevant for Non-Qubes-Whonix only.
