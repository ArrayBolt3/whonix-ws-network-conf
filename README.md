DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Workstations
Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports anonymized system DNS
for Workstation's traffic (also known as Transparent DNS Proxy) mainly depends
on the Gateway's firewall.

This package is simply installing /etc/resolv.conf which points to
10.152.152.10, where an Anon-Gateway is supposed to provide a DnsPort on port
53. IP HARDCODED but no need to change because only description.

Currently relevant for Non-Qubes-Whonix only.
